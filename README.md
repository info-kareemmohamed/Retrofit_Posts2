# Retrofit_Posts
This application was created to train me on Retrofit and MVVM and RecyclerView and CallBack
App Name: [Posts]

App Description:
[Posts] is a simple application developed using modern techniques for Android app development. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern and utilizes the Retrofit framework for API communication.

Retrofit Integration: The app utilizes Retrofit to make HTTP requests to the API and retrieve data asynchronously.

MVVM Architecture: [Posts] follows the MVVM architectural pattern, separating the application logic into three components: the Model, View, and ViewModel. This ensures a clear separation of concerns and promotes code reusability.

RecyclerView: The app incorporates the RecyclerView widget to efficiently display a list of items retrieved from the API. It provides a smooth scrolling experience and optimizes memory usage by recycling views.

RXJava Integration: [Posts] integrates RXJava, a popular reactive programming library, to handle asynchronous tasks and event-driven programming. RXJava simplifies managing background threads, data streams, and complex asynchronous operations, enhancing the app's responsiveness.
